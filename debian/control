Description: DragonScript Scripting Language
 Scripting language used by the Drag[en]gine Game Engine DragonScript
 Scripting module.
 .
 Features:
   - Object Oriented scripting language.
   - Strong typed with support for Late Binding and UpCast Code Blocks.
   - Simple syntax not requiring ";", "[", "{" or other special tokens.
     Typing code is faster since non-text characters are used with
     less frequency.
   - Streamable compilation. Grammar is look-ahead and look-back free
     allowing to stream in code character by character from
     non-seekable sources.
   - Single Inheritance with support for multiple interfaces.
   - Seemless mix-and-match of scripted and native functions/classes.
     Classes can contain both scripted and native functions/classes
     at the same time.
   - Easy to integrate as embedded language using C++ interface.
